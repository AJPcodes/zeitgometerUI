# ZeitgometerUI

A student project for Nashville Software School by Allen Phelps

A user interface to interact with Zeitgometer API, an IMB Watson Concept Insights-powered news article scraper and concept mapping program.

This project uses the React Framework with the Materialize CSS framework, along with React-plotly plugin for data visualization.

You can check out a live demo at http://zeitgometerui.herokuapp.com or follow the link at the top og the page.
Please note, initial load time may be a few moments, as the server boots up.

The program allows you to look at a list of recent headlines from Slate and Wired and view concept graphs of those headlines.
You can also search for articles matching a concept name or view a list of trending topics or most frequent concepts.

Enjoy.
